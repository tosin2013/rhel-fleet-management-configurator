minor_changes:
  - added limits to build_custom_collections and console_token_refresh JTs
  - updated install_configure playbook to match linting guidelines
  - fixed typos of 172.0.0.1 to the correct 127.0.0.1
  - added a block section to hub_config to also do custom collections
  - updated custom_collection playbook to run locally vs remote host
  - commented out vault file from build_ee playbook because I don't think it should be needed most of the time, leaving in case people do
  - commented out block/rescue section in controller_config because probably causes more issues then fixes
